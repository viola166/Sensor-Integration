     * \warning It is important that you do not perform any computation
     * intensive tasks in this callback. This would result in significant
     * delays in all the listener callbacks from being called. You should
     * delegate any intensive tasks to another thread or schedule it to run
     * with a delay through handler/scheduler for the platform.
     *
     * However, you can register/unregister listeners in this callback.
     * All previously registered listeners would still receive callbacks
     * for this current event. On subsequent events, the newly registered
     * listeners will be called. For example, if you had 2 listeners 'A' and 'B'
     * for this event. If, on the callback for listener A, listener A unregisters
     * all listeners and registers a new listener 'C' and then in the callback for
     * listener 'B', you unregister all listeners again and register a new listener
     * 'D'. Then on the subsequent event callback, only listener D's callback
     * will be invoked.
     *
     * \param packet The connection packet
     * \param muse   The \classlink{Muse} that sent the connection packet.
